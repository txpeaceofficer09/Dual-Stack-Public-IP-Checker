Your clients access your server either via an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address.  This means you can only see one address they access your server from per request.  To display both at once requires making two requests and forcing the use of IPv4 and IPv6 on separate requests.  I did this by creating sub-domains on the same server and giving one only an A record and the other sub-domain only an AAAA record.  Then I use jQuery $.get() to request each and return the value of the IP address on success or "Unavailable" on failure.

For this to work, create the sub-domains and hosting for each that listens on [::]:443 for the IPv6 and *:80 for IPv4.  Both hosts can point to the same root directory since they will each be serving the ip.php file.  On your primary domain that will display the public IPs, place the public.php.  Change the public.php file ipv4addr and ipv6addr variables to the actual addresses to the ip.php file in your IPv4 and IPv6 sub-domains and point your browser to the public.php file.
